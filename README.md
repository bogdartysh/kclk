based on 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55955926/how-to-reduce-the-size-of-the-access-refresh-tokens-in-keycloak

goals:
1. open source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services via JWT access tokens
2. based on Keycloak API thus very limited
3. thus with small (up to 255 chars) JWT access tokens only
